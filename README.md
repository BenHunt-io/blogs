# Who are you
Are you the hometown hero? Are you a farmer in a rural village? Are you a serial entrepreneur? Are you what your parents fantasize you to be? Are you a spooky lump of self aware atoms? What makes you, you?

Intuitively we are our bodies in it's entirety from head to toe. After all, I can move my toe with my brain and I can sure as hell feel when I stub my toe. So ha! That's who I am. Easy.

I've been thinking deeply about this.
