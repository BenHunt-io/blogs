# Who are you
Are you the hometown hero? Are you a farmer in a rural village? Are you a serial entrepreneur? Are you what your parents fantasize you to be? Are you a spooky lump of self aware atoms? What makes you, you?

Intuitively we are our bodies in it's entirety from head to toe. After all, I can move my toe with my brain and I can sure as hell feel when I stub my toe. So ha! That's who I am. Easy.

I've been thinking deeply about this. Unfortunately, there are seemingly endless facets in determining who you are. To ease this, let's start from a high level approach and work our way down to the core, much like you would going from country -> street view on Google Maps. It's easier to comprehend.

Let's take a step back for a second. Admire the mere fact that you are pondering who you are. You are the most complex thing in the Universe and you have no idea what makes you, you.

Let's begin with your identity. When pondering what makes you you, you likely conjure up some defining characteristic or attribute about yourself that you can definitively say is you. This typically comes in the form of an occupation. I'm a software developer. That's who I am. But is it really?
