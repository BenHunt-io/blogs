# Who are you
Are you skinny, fat, black, white, or none of the above? Are you a hometown hero? Are you a farmer in a rural village? Are you a serial entrepreneur? Are you what your parents fantasize you to be? Are you a spooky lump of self aware atoms? What makes you, **you?**

I'll volunteering to be the guinea pig in the following introspection. I've been thinking deeply about this lately, in attempts to get at the core of who I am. I won't delve into too much detail about myself as we are about to unravel the fabric of my own reality, but I'm 24, a software developer in Austin Texas and am trying to figure out what I want to do / should be doing with my life. In doing, so I believe this will help you find your true identity, what truly make you, you.

Fortunately (because our existence would be otherwise be boring if it were unfortunate), there are many many facets in examining who you are. If you aren't careful, you'll end up with analysis paralysis and know less about yourself than you when you began your search. This is analogous to using google maps. Imagine you were starting in New York and your destination was Austin Texas, you wouldn't start out from the extremely low level details of the street view and try to navigate to your destination with just left and right turns. You would get lost. You need to start from the country view, then the state view, then the city and so on. You cut out the unnecessary details. I don't need to know where Europe is with respect to Africa to go from New York to Austin.

We'll be examining my identity in a similar fashion, slowly unraveling layer by layer till we get to the destination, the core. We'll be removing unnecessary dependencies along the way, much like ignoring the spatial relationship of Africa to Europe. If you were to run into me on the street, who would I *appear* to be? I mean, if I were butt ass naked and there was no signs of culture associated with my physical appearance. The entity that see's me is on the same exact diet, and so the choice of nutrition cannot be drawn. 

### Physical Identity

![enter image description here](https://imgur.com/OGvx4oY.png)

Well upon first encounter, my natural appearance would be a 6'4" white male with brown eyes and brown hair at around 200lb. But what **is** it that you are encountering when you first meet someone? I didn't choose to be 6"4. I didn't choose to be white with brown eyes. Can you really draw any conclusions about a person's identity from their raw natural appearance? The only things you can possibly deduce are a few superficial things that aren't a reflection of the internal identity of the person, of me. You can deduce a **subset** of what their DNA might be. You can deduce that the person interacts with the world in a uniquely different subjective reality than your own. Just from the mathematical notion of infinity, no two people are the same height, their is an infinite number of fractions between 1 and 2 (1/2", 1/4", 1/8" and so on).  No two people share the same view of the world from merely a physical height perspective. This can be done for any of our senses. We have a different number of taste buds, the taste-buds themselves are different in composition. Our sense of hearing and sight vary drastically.

So, the entity on the sidewalk that sees me can draw a conclusion about **what** I interact in the world with, but not **who** is interacting with it. This one of the greatest facades and illusions. The physical manifestation of a person is merely the person's interface into the world. Fingers for a keyboard and eyes for a webcam. The keyboard and webcam don't describe the computer, they are purely peripheral components for interacting with the computer. You can swap them out and upgrade them as long as the components send signals the computer can understand. **You are interacting** *with* **the computer**  *through the* **peripheral components**

Take a person that was once deaf but receives cochlear implant (a electronic device that picks up sound and electrically stimulates the cochlear nerve in the ear, giving the patient the ability to hear). The person just got a new peripheral device, a new way to interact with the world. 

### Societal Identity

Alright. If my physical identity isn't really the true me. Then, surely it's **what I do** for hours on end, week after week right? I mean after all, whenever people ask who I am, they say I'm a software developer. I call this your **Societal Identity**. It is who society perceives you to be, by the actions you take. 

Unfortunately there's a multitude of problems identifying yourself by your profession. That might be what you do, but it is still not who you are. What you do can be largely influenced by dogma. Steve jobs once said, 

> Your time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. And don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your own heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary - Steve Jobs

You have to ask, why am I in the occupation that I am? Let's do a root cause analysis. 



### Wants / Desires / Tendencies



### Consciousness
The core you. The you after everything else dissolves away. No sights, smells, sounds, tastes, or physical sensations. No thoughts or even the perception of time. No ego or sense of identity remains. Without these components, we are left with something that is indistinguishable from one another, gender and life agnostic, a universal constant. We are left with consciousness. A state of pure existence and being.

##### How does consciousness emerge?
It doesn't. Awareness of consciousness, or the ability to draw a conclusion about your awareness emerges. Consciousness does not equal intellect, rather intellect gives rise to the ability to conclude that you indeed exist in this universe.

Take a moment to ponder your own existence. Why do you think you exist? Is it because you woke up this morning? Is it because you've endured hardship? Is it because you've lived through many colorful experiences?

Now let me ask you this. What is hardship if you can't remember the pain you endured? What is it like to go see your favorite artist if you can't recall who played? What is love without a relationship, a high level construct built on the perception of time.

You believe to exist as you've developed a complex ego. AN e



The you that is left after everything else dissolves away. No sensory input to give consciousness a unique experience. No colors, no smells, no feelings, no thoughts, no memories. Not even time can be perceived in a state of pure being. This state of existence is indistinguishable from one another. 

Consciousness isn't something that emerges out of us from infancy to adulthood. Rather, the ability to draw a conclusion about our awareness emerges. At infancy, we start from an initial configuration, an initial state with no memories of the 21st century. Stuck in the now, waiting for input from your 5 senses.

##### What we come pre-installed with:
 Lucky for us, on day 0, our brain isn't a completely empty slate. We inherit memories realized by **instincts**. We are familiar with instincts and how powerful they can be. The instinctual crave for sugary and fatty foods, or the insatiable want for lust and reproduction can be unbearable for some. Or that universal feeling of nausea when peering over a cliff, is the same instinctual feeling our ancestors experienced. It helped them survive and thus passing it down from generation to generation through DNA, genetic code. These instincts give us guardrails for the purpose of survival. This boot-loader type program is created in the brain during your 9-month journey in the womb. We can look at it as a universal set of guardrails that we come pre-installed with so that we can focus on what matters in our unique environment that we exist in.

##### What we don't come pre-installed with:
A model of the unique environment that we spawn in. Nor do we come pre-installed with concept of our existence within that model. We just have those instincts that are universally applicable no matter where on Earth you end up. You need food and you need to live long enough to reproduce.

##### Key components to awareness
One key component to achieving this state of awareness is the ability to create a **thought**.  When we think about being self-aware entities, we are self aware because we can think. René Descartes, puts it elegantly

> I think, therefore I am. (Latin for Cogito, ergo sum)

But what is a thought and why does it have the unique ability to draw conclusions about consciousness? Being aware of your own consciousness is tied directly to the concept of time. An entity, be it you, has to exist over some amount of time and then at a future time reference the previous state you were in. Being able to reference a previous state you were in, you can can then project into the future that you will exist then too. This is how an **Ego** develops. I existed then, I exist now, and therefore I exist in the future. Every time you think back to your own existence, you conclude that you are aware because you **remember** what you have done in the past. 

Humans are incredibly good at thinking about the future and the past.

### Time

Time is the key insight into consciousness awareness. But what is it? A simple way to think about it is, time is change. For something to change, it has to have a past and future state. For the ice in your drink to melt, it first has to go from solid to liquid. When we measure time, we are measuring change.

 - The brain therefore **reorganizes** the information and presents it in a more easily understandable form. In the case of familiar information, very little time is needed for this process, but new information requires more processing and this extra processing tends to makes time feel elongated. This is part of the reason why a child’s summer seems to last forever, while an old person’s well-practiced routine seems to slip away faster and faster. The more familiar the task, the less new information the brain needs to process, and the more quickly time seems to pass.
(This is because of the basal ganglia)
- In evolutionary terms, the ability to perceive time on very small scales may be the difference between life and death for small, vulnerable animals.
