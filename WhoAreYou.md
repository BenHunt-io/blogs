# Who are you
Are you skinny, fat, black, white, or none of the above? Are you a hometown hero? Are you a farmer in a rural village? Are you a serial entrepreneur? Are you what your parents fantasize you to be? Are you a spooky lump of self aware atoms? What makes you, **you?**

I'll volunteering to be the guinea pig in the following introspection. I've been thinking deeply about this lately, in attempts to get at the core of who I am. In doing, so I believe this will help you find your true identity, what truly make you, you.

Intuitively we are our bodies in it's entirety from head to toe. After all, I can move my toe with my brain and I can sure as hell feel when I stub my toe. So ha! That's who I am. Easy.

I've been thinking deeply about this. Unfortunately, there are seemingly endless facets in determining who you are. To ease this, let's start from a high level approach and work our way down to the core, much like you would going from country -> street view on Google Maps. It's easier to comprehend.

Let's take a step back for a second. Admire the mere fact that you are pondering who you are. You are the most complex thing in the Universe and you have no idea what makes you, you.

Let's begin with your identity. When pondering what makes you you, you likely conjure up some defining characteristic or attribute about yourself that you can definitively say is you. This typically comes in the form of an occupation. I'm a software developer. That's who I am. I mean that's what I'll be doing for virtually half my life. But is it really you?

**[identity picture]**

We need to dig deeper. Why is it that I am a software developer? After all, my occupation has only been around for less than 100 years and likely the same with yours. What if I was born in a different era? What if I wasn't born at all? How can your identity possibly be defined by something that has merely been a blink of an eye in the cosmic scale of the universe? The observable universe isn't 20, 30, 40 years old, but at-least 13.8 billion years old. 

Identity is a unique characteristic. What is unique about being a software developer? That is **NOT** unique.

0 Years --------------------------------------------------------> 13.8 billion

The universe in which we exist holds a few properties that can strip away our identity. *Time and Space.* These 4 dimensions largely determine who we are in the traditional sense for most people. 

**Time:** 13.8 billion years from the start of the universe I popped into existence. It was a peculiar time to do so. It had only been 36 years since we first stepped foot on the moon and Google did not yet exist.
**Place:** I was born in Dallas Texas, United States. "The land of the free". I have two loving parents, an older brother and sister.

Let's be generous and say you go on to become a centenarian, e.g. I live to see a nice even 100 years. From a cosmic perspective, I will have lived in a time slice that is 0.00000724% of the age of the universe or 100/13.8 billion years. A perspective that might be easier to grasp, is your unique sequential id. Each human whose every been born is assigned an id starting from 0. The "first" human is arbitrary and depends upon what we define as a homo sapiens. The count is currently around 105 billion.

There has been 105 billion unique environments in which people have been raised. If you were to grow up in all 105 billion environmental configurations that have so far existed for homo sapiens, would you still be a software engineer? No. You wouldn't. Occupations, like software engineering, tribe leader, and lead pyramid architect only exist in a minute subset of the configurations. They only exist a glimpse in time. These occupations seemingly define your identity, who you are, yet only exist as a product of evolutionary progress.

**What you do** depends upon the environmental configuration in which you exist. Whether it be now as a software developer or hunter gatherer much more long ago, the available options are dependent upon time and place. This serves a lousy framework for determining **who you are**. 

Well, each one of us has wants and desires. Some want to be rich. Some want fame. Some want to simply do good for others. Could it be that your wants and desires are molded to best-fit your environmental configuration? 

Everyone has a multitude of wants.

Who you truly are is independent of the environmental configuration in which you exist. 


Is this the only time and place that could have yielded me?
