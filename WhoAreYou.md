# Who are you
Are you skinny, fat, black, white, or none of the above? Are you a hometown hero? Are you a farmer in a rural village? Are you a serial entrepreneur? Are you what your parents fantasize you to be? Are you a spooky lump of self aware atoms? What makes you, **you?**

I'll volunteering to be the guinea pig in the following introspection. I've been thinking deeply about this lately, in attempts to get at the core of who I am. I won't delve into too much detail about myself as we are about to unravel the fabric of my own reality, but I'm 24, a software developer in Austin Texas and am trying to figure out what I want to do / should be doing with my life. In doing, so I believe this will help you find your true identity, what truly make you, you.

Fortunately (because our existence would be otherwise be boring if it were unfortunate), there are many many facets in examining who you are. If you aren't careful, you'll end up with analysis paralysis and know less about yourself than you when you began your search. This is analogous to using google maps. Imagine you were starting in New York and your destination was Austin Texas, you wouldn't start out from the extremely low level details of the street view and try to navigate to your destination with just left and right turns. You would get lost. You need to start from the country view, then the state view, then the city and so on. You cut out the unnecessary details. I don't need to know where Europe is with respect to Africa to go from New York to Austin.

We'll be examining my identity in a similar fashion, slowly unraveling layer by layer till we get to the destination, the core. We'll be removing unnecessary dependencies along the way, much like ignoring the spatial relationship of Africa to Europe. If you were to run into me on the street, who would I *appear* to be? I mean, if I were butt ass naked and there was no signs of culture associated with my physical appearance. The entity that see's me is on the same exact diet, and so the choice of nutrition cannot be drawn. 

### Physical Identity

![enter image description here](https://imgur.com/OGvx4oY.png)

Well upon first encounter, my natural appearance would be a 6'4" white male with brown eyes and brown hair at around 200lb. But what **is** it that you are encountering when you first meet someone? I didn't choose to be 6"4. I didn't choose to be white with brown eyes. Can you really draw any conclusions about a person's identity from their raw natural appearance? The only things you can possibly deduce are a few superficial things that aren't a reflection of the internal identity of the person, of me. You can deduce a **subset** of what their DNA might be. You can deduce that the person interacts with the world in a uniquely different subjective reality than your own. Just from the mathematical notion of infinity, no two people are the same height, their is an infinite number of fractions between 1 and 2 (1/2", 1/4", 1/8" and so on).  No two people share the same view of the world from merely a physical height perspective. This can be done for any of our senses. We have a different number of taste buds, the taste-buds themselves are different in composition. Our sense of hearing and sight vary drastically.

So, the entity on the sidewalk that sees me can draw a conclusion about **what** I interact in the world with, but not **who** is interacting with it. This one of the greatest facades and illusions. The physical manifestation of a person is merely the person's interface into the world. Fingers for a keyboard and eyes for a webcam. The keyboard and webcam don't describe the computer, they are purely peripheral components for interacting with the computer. You can swap them out and upgrade them as long as the components send signals the computer can understand. **You are interacting** *with* **the computer**  *through the* **peripheral components**

Take a person that was once deaf but receives cochlear implant (a electronic device that picks up sound and electrically stimulates the cochlear nerve in the ear, giving the patient the ability to hear). The person just got a new peripheral device, a new way to interact with the world. 

### Societal Identity

Alright. If my physical identity isn't really the true me. Then, surely it's **what I do** for hours on end, week after week right? I mean after all, whenever people ask who I am, they say I'm a software developer. I call this your **Societal Identity**. It is who society perceives you to be, by the actions you take. 

Unfortunately there's a multitude of problems identifying yourself by your profession. That might be what you do, but it is still not who you are. What you do can be largely influenced by dogma. Steve jobs once said, 

> Your time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. And don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your own heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary - Steve Jobs

You have to ask, why am I in the occupation that I am? Let's do a root cause analysis. 



### Wants / Desires / Tendencies



### Consciousness
Consciousness. The core. The you that is left after everything dissolves away. No sensory input to give consciousness existence. No colors, no smells, no feelings, no thoughts, no memories. Not even time can be perceived in a state of pure being. This state of existence is indistinguishable from one another. 

Consciousness isn't something that emerges out of us from infancy to adulthood. Rather, the ability to draw a conclusion about our awareness emerges. At infancy, we start from an initial configuration, an initial state with no memories. Stuck in the now, waiting for input from your 5 senses. Over eon's we've developed a useful boot-loader program that takes 9 months to develop in the womb.

One key component to achieving this state of awareness is the ability to create a **thought**.  When we think about being self-aware entities, we are self aware because we can think. René Descartes, puts it elegantly

> I think, therefore I am. (Latin for Cogito, ergo sum)

But what is a thought and why does it have the unique ability to draw conclusions about consciousness? Being aware of your own consciousness is tied directly to the concept of time. An entity, be it you, has to exist over some amount of time and then at a future time reference the previous state you were in. Being able to reference a previous state you were in, you can can then project into the future that you will exist then too. This is how an **Ego** develops. I existed then, I exist now, and therefore I exist in the future. Every time you think back to your own existence, you conclude that you are aware because you **remember** what you have done in the past. 

Humans are incredibly good at thinking about the future and the past.

### Time

Time is the key insight into consciousness awareness. But what is it? A simple way to think about it is, time is change. For something to change, it has to have a past and future state. For the ice in your drink to melt, it first has to go from solid to liquid. When we measure time, we are measuring change.




### Quantum Physics


 Then who is it that is driving my body to complete all the tasks throughout the day? Who is it that is telling my body to get up at the butt crack of dawn and go to work?





A entity, say Bob, says to the box "Hi Ben, how are you this evening?". Ben responds, "I'm doing well thank you, I just got a promotion and am feeling great". Birds chirping from the nearby tree send sound waves to the box, and the box says, "That's some annoying ass birds".




**[identity picture]**

We need to dig deeper. Why is it that I am a software developer? After all, my occupation has only been around for less than 100 years and likely the same with yours. What if I was born in a different era? What if I wasn't born at all? How can your identity possibly be defined by something that has merely been a blink of an eye in the cosmic scale of the universe? The observable universe isn't 20, 30, 40 years old, but at-least 13.8 billion years old. 

Identity is a unique characteristic. What is unique about being a software developer? That is **NOT** unique.

0 Years --------------------------------------------------------> 13.8 billion

The universe in which we exist holds a few properties that can strip away our identity. *Time and Space.* These 4 dimensions largely determine who we are in the traditional sense for most people. 

**Time:** 13.8 billion years from the start of the universe I popped into existence. It was a peculiar time to do so. It had only been 36 years since we first stepped foot on the moon and Google did not yet exist.
**Place:** I was born in Dallas Texas, United States. "The land of the free". I have two loving parents, an older brother and sister.

Let's be generous and say you go on to become a centenarian, e.g. I live to see a nice even 100 years. From a cosmic perspective, I will have lived in a time slice that is 0.00000724% of the age of the universe or 100/13.8 billion years. A perspective that might be easier to grasp, is your unique sequential id. Each human whose every been born is assigned an id starting from 0. The "first" human is arbitrary and depends upon what we define as a homo sapiens. The count is currently around 105 billion.

There has been 105 billion unique environments in which people have been raised. If you were to grow up in all 105 billion environmental configurations that have so far existed for homo sapiens, would you still be a software engineer? No. You wouldn't. Occupations, like software engineering, tribe leader, and lead pyramid architect only exist in a minute subset of the configurations. They only exist a glimpse in time. These occupations seemingly define your identity, who you are, yet only exist as a product of evolutionary progress.

**What you do** depends upon the environmental configuration in which you exist. Whether it be now as a software developer or hunter gatherer much more long ago, the available options are dependent upon time and place. This serves a lousy framework for determining **who you are**. 

Well, each one of us has wants and desires. Some want to be rich. Some want fame. Some want to simply do good for others. Could it be that your wants and desires are molded to best-fit your environmental configuration? 

Everyone has a multitude of wants.
|Wants  |  |
|--|--|
| Personal|  |
| Social|  |
| Moral	|		|
| Practical |  |
| Lifestyle		| 		|

Who you truly are is independent of the environmental configuration in which you exist. 


Is this the only time and place that could have yielded me?
