# Who are you
Are you skinny, fat, black, white, or none of the above? Are you a hometown hero? Are you a farmer in a rural village? Are you a serial entrepreneur? Are you what your parents fantasize you to be? Are you a spooky lump of self aware atoms? What makes you, **you?**

I'll volunteering to be the guinea pig in the following introspection. I've been thinking deeply about this lately, in attempts to get at the core of who I am. I won't delve into too much detail about myself as we are about to unravel the fabric of my own reality, but I'm 24, a software developer in Austin Texas and am trying to figure out what I want to do / should be doing with my life. In doing, so I believe this will help you find your true identity, what truly make you, you.

Fortunately (because our existence would be otherwise be boring if it were unfortunate), there are many many facets in examining who you are. If you aren't careful, you'll end up with analysis paralysis and know less about yourself than you when you began your search. This is analogous to using google maps. Imagine you were starting in New York and your destination was Austin Texas, you wouldn't start out from the extremely low level details of the street view and try to navigate to your destination with just left and right turns. You would get lost. You need to start from the country view, then the state view, then the city and so on. You cut out the unnecessary details. I don't need to know where Europe is with respect to Africa to go from New York to Austin.

We'll be examining my identity in a similar fashion, slowly unraveling layer by layer till we get to the destination, the core. We'll be removing unnecessary dependencies along the way, much like ignoring the spatial relationship of Africa to Europe. If you were to run into me on the street, who would I *appear* to be? I mean, if I were butt ass naked and there was no signs of culture associated with my physical appearance. Diet and physical fitness are irrelevant in this example. Assume these to bea the same between myself and the entity. We are examining raw appearance.

### Physical Identity

![enter image description here](https://imgur.com/OGvx4oY.png)

Well upon first encounter, my natural appearance would be a 6'4" white male with brown eyes and brown hair at around 200lb. But what **is** it that you are encountering when you first meet someone? I didn't choose to be 6"4. I didn't choose to be white with brown eyes. Can you really draw any conclusions about a person's identity, who they are, from their raw natural appearance? My raw natural appearance was decided before I was born. It was decided when I won the galactic lottery, at conception. It had been coded in my DNA, the genetic instructions for building me, including my physical raw appearance as I mature.

You can deduce  a **subset** of what my DNA might be that had produced my notable physical traits. You can deduce that the I interact with the world in a uniquely different subjective reality than your own. No two people stand the same height. No two people have the vision. No two people have the same hearing capabilities. We often judge people as if they are interfacing with the world in the same way as you. In this way, we can only be empathetic to a degree, we cannot truly step in their shoes. My model of the world is not the same as yours nor is yours is the same as anybody else. My unique model of the world is built through my interface with it, via my body, that is permutation of all the feedback loops produced from my senses. This subjective reality, this model of the world I build is known as your **umvelt**

|Senses (feedback loops)| Composition |
|--|--|
|Sight| long/short sighted / depth perception / lateral masking / facial recognition / perception of color / light sensitivity / motion perception / resolution
|Hearing | frequency range, vertical spatial locality, horizontal spatial, locality, mechanical to neural transduction loss  |
|Smell | perception of an odor, distinguishability of odors, aversion to odors, general ability |
|Taste | sweetness, sourness, saltiness, punginency, astringency, metallicness |
|Touch | pain tolerance, pleasure, fine touch, crude touch, passive tactile spatial acuity, balance, temperature |

Your umvelt, or subjective reality is built upon the permutation of these senses (plus other mental capacities). This is a short list. I couldn't possibly list out every permutation, there are gradients to each attribute. For instance, there are thousands if not more levels to sweetness. My fingerprint is unique and it is such a minute attribute in the totality of what comprises my umvelt. But, just because I interact uniquely with the world does not mean that defines who I am, it's just merely what I've been given to use via my DNA. 

So, the entity on the sidewalk that sees me can draw a conclusion about **what** I interact in the world with, but not **who** is interacting with it. This one of the greatest facades that we live with on day to day basis. The physical manifestation of a person is merely the person's interface into the world. For example, the keyboard and webcam don't describe the computer, they are purely peripheral components for interacting with the computer. You can swap them out and upgrade them as long as the components send signals the computer can understand. **You are interacting** *with* **the computer**  *through the* **peripheral components**

Okay. I get it. Don't judge a book by it's cover. 

### Societal Identity

If my physical identity isn't really the true me. Then, surely it's **what I do** for hours on end, week after week right? I mean after all, whenever people ask who I am, they say I'm a software developer. I call this your **Societal Identity**. It is who society perceives you to be, by the actions you take. 

Unfortunately there's a multitude of problems identifying yourself by your profession. That might be what you do, but it is still not who you are. There are too many external influences that affect what you ultimately end up doing.

##### Time and Place
Time and place are by in large the biggest in influencing factors. 

It's a label which makes a rough approximation of your wants / desires / tendencies which is often flat out wrong.


What you do can be largely influenced by dogma. Steve jobs once said, 

> Your time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. And don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your own heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary - Steve Jobs

You have to ask, why am I in the occupation that I am? Let's do a root cause analysis. 



### Wants / Desires / Tendencies

### Consciousness
The core you. The you after everything else dissolves away. No sights, smells, sounds, tastes, or physical sensations. No thoughts or even the perception of time. No ego or sense of identity remains. Without these components, we are left with something that is indistinguishable from one another, gender and life agnostic, a universal constant. We are left with consciousness. A state of pure existence and being.

##### How does consciousness emerge?
It doesn't. Awareness of consciousness, or the ability to draw a conclusion about your awareness emerges. Consciousness does not equal intellect, rather intellect gives rise to the ability to conclude that you indeed exist in this universe.

Take a moment to ponder your own existence. Why do you think you exist? Is it because you woke up this morning? Is it because you've endured hardship? Is it because you saw your favorite artist a week ago?

Now let me ask you this. What if you didn't remember that you woke up this morning? What is hardship if you can't remember the pain you endured? What is it like to go see your favorite artist if you can't recall who played? What is love without a relationship, a high level construct built on the perception of time.

You believe to exist by virtue of your ego, a perception of self, that you've constructed, day by day, since the moment you were born. This ego is who you likely call you. This ego is realized through the development of a perception of time and your existence within it.  When you were born, you were lucky enough to be given a bunch of starter programs, or instincts. These programs help you survive, by giving you a set of guardrails. A program for the fear of heights, a program for your digestion and sight. What you don't come into the world with, is a history of you. What happened yesterday? There was no yesterday. There was only now. You aren't born with an ego. However, you are born with the ability to develop an ego, with two important ingredients; memories and thoughts.

**Memories**, created within the memory center of the brain, the hippocampus, are essential ingredients into building an ego. For a sense of self to emerge,  an entity, be it you, has to exist over some amount of time and then at a future time reference the previous state you were in. Being able to reference a previous state you were in, you can can then project into the future that you will exist then too. Note, the previous state MUST be different otherwise it would be indistinguishable from the now. This is how an **Ego** develops. I existed then, I exist now, and therefore I exist in the future. Every time you think back to your own existence, you conclude that you are aware because you **remember** what you have done in the past. Memories alone don't suffice for conscious awareness. A memory without something to decode it, is just data; void of meaning. Some engine, must be able to analyze these memories and make high level conclusions about them.

**Thoughts** are necessary in conjunction with memories in building a sense of self. The generation of them are believed to reside in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain responsible for memory, planning and abstract thinking. Thoughts are small or large predictions about the future. Memories serve no evolutionary purpose without something to consume or learn from them.

 This is analogous to that of machine learning, where in instead a set of memories, there is some set of data set that is fed 

 Thoughts are largely the ability to take memories and predict the future. Take stress. Stress arises from thoughts. Thoughts that predict a future w

##### Consciousness in the animal kingdom
Are animals conscious? Is my dog conscious? Well. Yes. And he's the same amount conscious as you. He's just simply not as aware as you. The animal kingdom has a gradient of awareness. To illustrate, I'm going to borrow an idea from "The Future of the Mind" by Michio Kaku. Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist and author known for his work in String Field theory.

##### What we come pre-installed with:
 Lucky for us, on day 0, our brain isn't a completely empty slate. We inherit memories realized by **instincts**. We are familiar with instincts and how powerful they can be. The instinctual crave for sugary and fatty foods, or the insatiable want for lust and reproduction can be unbearable for some. Or that universal feeling of nausea when peering over a cliff, is the same instinctual feeling our ancestors experienced. It helped them survive and thus passing it down from generation to generation through DNA, genetic code. These instincts give us guardrails for the purpose of survival. This boot-loader type program is created in the brain during your 9-month journey in the womb. We can look at it as a universal set of guardrails that we come pre-installed with so that we can focus on what matters in our unique environment that we exist in.

##### What we don't come pre-installed with:
A model of the unique environment that we spawn in. Nor do we come pre-installed with concept of our existence within that model. We just have those instincts that are universally applicable no matter where on Earth you end up. You need food and you need to live long enough to reproduce.

##### Key components to awareness
One key component to achieving this state of awareness is the ability to create a **thought**.  When we think about being self-aware entities, we are self aware because we can think. René Descartes, puts it elegantly

> I think, therefore I am. (Latin for Cogito, ergo sum)

But what is a thought and why does it have the unique ability to draw conclusions about consciousness? Being aware of your own consciousness is tied directly to the concept of time. An entity, be it you, has to exist over some amount of time and then at a future time reference the previous state you were in. Being able to reference a previous state you were in, you can can then project into the future that you will exist then too. This is how an **Ego** develops. I existed then, I exist now, and therefore I exist in the future. Every time you think back to your own existence, you conclude that you are aware because you **remember** what you have done in the past. 

Humans are incredibly good at thinking about the future and the past.

### Time

Time is the key insight into consciousness awareness. But what is it? A simple way to think about it is, time is change. For something to change, it has to have a past and future state. For the ice in your drink to melt, it first has to go from solid to liquid. When we measure time, we are measuring change.

 - The brain therefore **reorganizes** the information and presents it in a more easily understandable form. In the case of familiar information, very little time is needed for this process, but new information requires more processing and this extra processing tends to makes time feel elongated. This is part of the reason why a child’s summer seems to last forever, while an old person’s well-practiced routine seems to slip away faster and faster. The more familiar the task, the less new information the brain needs to process, and the more quickly time seems to pass.
(This is because of the basal ganglia)
- In evolutionary terms, the ability to perceive time on very small scales may be the difference between life and death for small, vulnerable animals.
